# HACK OHIO 12
Hack OHIO 12 Repository
Our project takes a live audio file and converts it into a text document. From there, we analyze the text to find slang words and use a GUI to create a window that printed out statements with the slang terms hyperlinked. When interacted with, the link will use Urban Dictionaryâ€™s API to find the definition and provide and example of the term in a sentence.
